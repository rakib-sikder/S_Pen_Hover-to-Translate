# S Pen Hover-to-Translate

**S Pen Hover-to-Translate** is an intelligent Android application designed to provide seamless, on-the-fly translations without ever leaving your current app. It leverages the power of Samsung's S Pen for an intuitive hover-to-select experience and offers robust fallback options, including OCR, to capture and translate text from any source on your screen.

![App Demo](https://i.imgur.com/image.png) ## ‚ú® Key Features

- **S Pen Integration (Conceptual):** Designed with S Pen users in mind, allowing for precise text selection and a unique hover-based interaction model.
- **Universal Select-to-Translate:** Activate the feature and select text in **any app**‚Äîbrowsers, social media, PDFs, or note-taking apps‚Äîto get an instant translation in a floating tooltip.
- **Intelligent Text Capture (Waterfall Strategy):**
    - **Priority 1 (Modern API):** Uses the latest `getSelectedText()` API for the most efficient text capture on Android 14+.
    - **Priority 2 (Standard Accessibility):** Falls back to standard accessibility properties (`textSelectionStart`/`End`) for broad compatibility with most apps.
    - **Priority 3 (OCR - Last Resort):** For difficult-to-read sources like certain PDFs or apps with custom UIs, it uses **On-Device OCR** with screen capture to recognize text that would otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Floating Language Controller:**
    - When active, a persistent floating widget gives you full control.
    - Instantly change the source and target languages without opening the main app.
    - Includes an **"Auto-Detect"** option for the source language, powered by ML Kit Language ID.
- **On-Device Machine Learning:**
    - All language detection and translation are performed securely on your device using **Google's ML Kit**.
    - Works offline after the required language models have been downloaded.
- **In-App Translator:** Includes a standard screen for manually typing and translating text.
